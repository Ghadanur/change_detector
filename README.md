# change_detector in Verilog
{A signal transition detection module with testbench}

This project implements a change detector in Verilog that:

Detects transitions (0→1 or 1→0) in an input signal (sig).

Synchronizes with a clock (clk) and reset (rst).

Outputs a pulse (det_out) when a change is detected.
